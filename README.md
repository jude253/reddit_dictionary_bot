# reddit_dictionary_bot
This bot searchs through a bunch of comments on reddit and when it finds a comment says "define &lt;word>" it is going to reply to that comment with the definition of &lt;word>.  It used the praw reddit package for python and reddit APIs to get the reddit posts, comments, reply, etc... and the oxford dictionary API to define the word.
